This installation shell script will examine your system and ask you questions
to determine how ash should be installed.  If you get stuck on a question,
you may use a ! shell escape to start a subshell or execute a command.  Many
of the questions will have default answers in square brackets--typing carriage
return will give you the default.

If this shell script doesn't work for some reason, you will have to create
shell.h by hand.  This isn't too hard to do; sample versions of shell.h for
for Berkeley UNIX and System V are included in the distribution.  Also, if
you make a mistake in answering a question, you can edit shell.h after this
procedure finishes.
